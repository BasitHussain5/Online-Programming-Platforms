Question 1
Introduction and Learning Outcomes
The goal of this assignment is to practice with logarithms that appear frequently in the analysis of algorithms.

Recall that \log_anlog 
a
​
 n is the power to which you need to raise aa in order to obtain nn.

The main rules for working with logarithms are the following:

loga(nk)=klogan
loga(nm)=logan+logam
nlogab=blogan
logan⋅logba=logbn
