Adjusting a Dark and Rotated Image
Gamma Correction is a common image adjustment technique. Each pixel in an image is raised to a power, gamma, such that
 
In this problem you will adjust the brightness using gamma correction and correct the rotation of the Boston Night image.
Write a script that converts the "boston night.JPG" image to grayscale and performs the following two adjustments:
adjust the intensity using  in the above equation
rotate the image 1 degree clockwise while maintaining the same image dimensions
Store your final image as uint8 in a variable named imgAdjusted
You're encouraged to work in MATLAB to develop your solution before testing it here. 


Solution

img = imread("boston night.JPG");
% Enter your code below

% Load the image
img = rgb2gray(img);

% Perform gamma correction
img = imadjust(img, [], [], 0.5);

% Rotate the image 1 degree clockwise
img = imrotate(img, -1, 'crop');

% Scale the image to uint8
imgAdjusted = uint8(img);

% Save the final image
imwrite(imgAdjusted, 'boston_night_adjusted.JPG');

imshow(img)
